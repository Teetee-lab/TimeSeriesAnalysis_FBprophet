# Time Series Analysis with FBprophet Library

Time series forecasting can be demanding as there are many different methods you could use and many hyperparameters for each method. As a data scientist what if there is a third-party library that could perform all the fine-tuning within and you just need to feed the model and wait for the magic to happen. The answer to the question is the Facebook prophet library. In this repository, I will explore Facebook Prophet using the milk dataset from kaggle to understand time series forecasting and the changepoints.
